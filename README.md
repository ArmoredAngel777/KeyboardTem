# KeyboardTem
This is a custom keyboard for Tem language

It is roughly based on the French style azerty keyboard and includes easy access to diacritics and characters used by the Tem people.
This keyboard Utilizes some less common Unicode points.

Currently crashing when trying to give the diacritic keys a gray background while the remaining keys have white backgrounds (different colors currently being used to make formatting easier to see).
